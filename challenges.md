# Challenges  

- ## Identifying meaningful gaps and enrichment possibilities

One of the first challenges was identifying a meaningful gap in the <a href="http://wit.istc.cnr.it/arco">ArCo</a> Knowledge Graph that could be enriched in a valid and relevant way. This required analyzing the existing data and understanding the structure and limits of the <a href="http://wit.istc.cnr.it/arco/lode/extract?lang=en&url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ICCD-MiBACT/ArCo/master/ArCo-release/ontologie/arco/arco.owl">ArCo ontology</a>. We needed to ensure that any proposed enrichment was supported by the available vocabulary and aligned with its domain logic. In some cases, even when interesting insights emerged—such as references to family members of instrument makers—we could not formalize them due to missing ontological connections. This process highlighted the importance of treating the ontology not just as a technical tool, but as a guide for what knowledge can be represented, and how. 

- ## Ontological Alignment
One of the biggest challenges was making sure the triples generated by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">Large Language Models</a> followed the strict structure of the <a href="http://wit.istc.cnr.it/arco/lode/extract?lang=en&url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ICCD-MiBACT/ArCo/master/ArCo-release/ontologie/arco/arco.owl">ArCo ontology</a>. ArCo has detailed rules about which classes and properties can be used together, and even small mistakes—like assigning a property to the wrong class—could lead to invalid data or broken <a href="https://dati.cultura.gov.it/sparql">SPARQL</a> queries. Since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">LLMs</a> don’t naturally follow ontologies, we had to carefully design prompts, review the outputs, and check both the structure and meaning of each triple to ensure they were valid.

- ## Reasoning with Chain-of-Thought
Using chain-of-thought prompting helped the models reason more clearly and produce better <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework">RDF</a> triples. However, it also made their answers longer and sometimes too detailed or repetitive. We often had to clean up the outputs and extract just the useful parts. Finding the right balance between detailed reasoning and concise, usable data was a recurring issue.

- ## Methodology Complexity
The whole process—from writing <a href="https://dati.cultura.gov.it/sparql">SPARQL</a> queries to crafting prompts, validating outputs, and adding them back into the graph—was quite complex. Each step depended on the others, so a small error early on could cause problems later. To handle this challenge, we divided the process into simpler, manageable steps and carefully improved each one before putting everything together.
