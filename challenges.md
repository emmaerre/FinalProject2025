# Challenges  

## * Ontological Alignment
One of the first and most complex challenges we encountered was aligning the outputs generated by language models with the strict schema imposed by the ArCo ontology. ArCo, designed to represent Italian cultural heritage, defines detailed classes and properties with precise domain and range constraints. Language models, however, produce text based on probabilistic patterns and are not inherently aware of these ontological rules. Even small semantic deviations—such as using a property with an incorrect class—could compromise the graph's consistency or cause SPARQL query failures. To address this, we had to experiment with prompt design, output parsing, and validation mechanisms to ensure both structural and semantic correctness of the generated triples.
