# Enriching ArCo: Knowledge Graph Enhancement through LLMs | Exploring musical instrument and semantic gaps in Cultural Heritage data.


This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## About the project

This project explores how SPARQL, RDF modeling, and Large Language Models (LLMs) can be combined to enrich the [ArCo Knowledge Graph](https://dati.beniculturali.it/arco/), focusing on musical instruments, particularly the trombone.

We applied a variety of prompting techniques—including zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting—to guide LLMs in producing useful, ontology-compliant triples and structured suggestions for data enrichment.

## Key objectives 

•	Identify and investigate semantic **gaps** in ArCo’s [Music Heritage section](https://dati.beniculturali.it/arco/resource/MusicHeritage)   
•	**Enrich** instrument entries (like the trombone) with missing classifications, construction techniques, and semantic metadata   
•	Employ [LLMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) to support and automate **RDF** generation    
•	Demonstrate the value of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting in complex cultural data reasoning      
•	Evaluate limitations when suggested entities are not represented in the knowledge graph

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
