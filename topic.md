## Topic 

This project explores the intersection of language technologies and semantic web tools in the context of cultural heritage data. After evaluating different areas of the [ArCo knowledge graph](https://dati.beniculturali.it/arco/), we chose to focus on the [Music Heritage](https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/arco/MusicHeritage) and [Musical Instrument Classification](https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/arco/MusicalInstrumentClassification) sections. This domain offered a promising ground for identifying content gaps and developing meaningful strategies for data enrichment.

The decision to concentrate on musical instruments —and in particular on the trombone— was based on the potential to detect underrepresented elements within the dataset and explore how they could be semantically integrated. Among the various classes we examined, [Music Heritage](https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/arco/MusicHeritage) and [Musical Instrument Classification](https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/arco/MusicalInstrumentClassification) stood out as especially suitable for our goals, due to their conceptual clarity, real-world relevance, and openness to enhancement through both internal analysis and external sources.

Our aim was to understand how semantic gaps emerge in structured data and how they might be addressed using a combination of knowledge graph reasoning, ontology-driven modeling, and language-based support tools.
